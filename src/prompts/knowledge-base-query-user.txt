DEPRECATED: This prompt is no longer used. Knowledge base queries now use OpenAI's file search API directly through the FileSearchService. The file search API constructs queries internally and searches through the vector store without requiring custom prompt templates.

The new approach uses the OpenAI Responses API with file_search tool, which automatically:
1. Processes the customer question and conversation context
2. Searches the vector store using semantic search
3. Generates responses with proper citations
4. Handles professional formatting and error cases
