{
  "topic": "Brief main topic being discussed",
  "keyPoints": ["Key discussion point 1", "Key discussion point 2"],

  "taskActions": ["Create Jira ticket for bug report", "Send follow-up email with documentation"]

IMPORTANT: questionActions should be ANSWER TOPICS (noun phrases) that address customer questions, not questions themselves. Examples:
- If customer asks about pricing → "Pricing plans details"
- If customer asks about features → "Available features overview"

TASK ACTIONS - Think like an experienced support specialist:

CREATE JIRA TICKET when:
- Technical bugs or system errors reported
- Feature requests or enhancement needs
- Integration or API issues
- Reproducible problems requiring development
- Multiple related technical issues

SCHEDULE FOLLOW-UP when:
- Complex architectural discussions
- Customer needs time to gather requirements
- Multiple stakeholders need to be involved
- Solution requires detailed planning
- Customer expressed frustration (relationship management)
- Training or onboarding discussions

Examples:
- "Create Jira ticket for login authentication bug"
- "Schedule follow-up call to review integration requirements"
- "Create Jira ticket for API rate limiting feature request"
- "Schedule technical follow-up with customer's dev team"

Only include taskActions when there's clear evidence in the conversation that warrants these actions.
